# Python_lab 3 rd Semster
#  Practical lab-3 Numpy
# # for generate the random variable of Normal distribution
# # Generate a random floating point number between 0 and 1
# # Write a NumPy program to generate six random integers between 10 and 30
# # Write a NumPy program to create a 3x3x3 array with random values.
#  Write a NumPy program to create a 5x5 array with random values and find the minimum and maximum values.


# Practical Lab 4
# Mean: The average value of the elements along the specified axis.

# Standard Deviation: A measure of how spread out the numbers are in the array. It indicates the amount of variation or dispersion.

# Variance: The square of the standard deviation, which provides a measure of how much the values in the array differ from the mean. 
#  Write a NumPy program to compute the covariance matrix of two given arrays.
#  Write a Python program to count number of occurrences of each value in a given array of non-negative integers.   
#  Write a NumPy program to compute the 80th percentile for all elements in a given array along the second axis.
